# advent-of-code

I tried playing at the 2020 advent of code [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/). I lacked the time (and now the motivation) to go further. I did enjoy some of my algorithms for some puzzles. I've got one friend who said the seating calculator was "elegant yet horrendous" and I find it beautiful.
